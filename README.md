# MatplotLib Treatment Study


# Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company specialises in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The task is to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and a top-level summary of the study results.

Instructions
- Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen
- Generate a bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen
- Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice
- Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
- Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens
- Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group
- Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin
- Generate a scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model
